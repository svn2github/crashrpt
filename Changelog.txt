======= Change History ========

--- Ver. 1.3.1 ---

- Reorganized demos (moved to demos folder and renamed CrashRptTest=>WTLDemo, crashcon=>ConsoleDemo).
- Fixed: Impossible to send Crash reports in Windows 7 64bits (issue 104).
- Fixed: Crash report is not discarded when 'Close the program' is selected (issue 94).
- Fixed: Application is restarted twice after crash (issue 115).
- Fixed: CRP_COL_PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION not working (issue 118).
- Fixed: Improve robustness to stack overflow (issue 121).
- Fixed: When copying a log file into the crash archive, access it with FILE_SHARE_WRITE (issue 124)
- Fixed: Support multiple e-mail recipients (issue 123).

- New: Added CR_INST_SEND_MANDATORY flag. This flag removes the "Close" and "Other actions" buttons 
       from Error Report dialog, thus making the sending procedure mandatory for user (issue 126).

- Fixed: Support multiple crash reports per application instance (issue 127)

--- Ver. 1.3.0 ---

- Added support of CMake - cross-plaform make system. Although CrashRpt doesn't support operating systems
  other than Windows, CMake makes it easier to maintain build configurations for different versions of Visual Studio.
  Project files for VC++ .NET 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010 and VC++ Express can be generated.

- Added instructions to the documentation on how to generate Visual Studio project files with CMake.

- Removed project files for Visual Studio 2003 (CrashRpt_v2003.sln) and Visual Studio 2005 (CrashRpt_v2005.sln). 
  To compile in VS2010, use Visual Studio 2010 project files (or use CMake to generate Visual Studio project 
  files for your favorite version of Visual Studio).

- Binary files now have version suffices (CrashRpt1300.dll, CrashRptProbe1300.dll and CrashSender1300.exe). This is
  to resolve problems of loading incorrect version of the DLL.

- Removed obsolete API InstallW, InstallA, Uninstall, AddFileW, AddFileA, GenerateErrorReport.

- Added an ability to select/deselect/delete all error reports and delete selected reports in ResendDlg (issue 112).

- Updated Italian lang file (issue 92).
- Updated German lang file (issue 98).
- Updated French lang file (issue 107).

- Fixed: CrashSender fails to initialize if two files both have empty destination properties (issue 88)
- Fixed: DestroyView fails in SharedMem implementation (issue 93)
- Fixed: CHttpRequestSender::InternalSend() sends bad request header (issue 95)
- Fixed: Potential buffer overflow in CHttpRequestSender::InternalSend() (issue 96)
- Fixed: Formatting / coding request (issue 97)
- Fixed: Typo in string conversion class (issue 99)
- Fixed: Compilation fails if build directory contains spaces (issue 100)
- Fixed:The space confuses some mail servers, the RFC for QUIT defines that there should be no space. (issue 105)
- Fixed: RFC correct base64 for SMTP send (issue 106)
- Fixed: Wrong handling of dwFlags when setting handlers (issue 109)
- Fixed: SMTP fails if Date header missing (issue 110)

--- Ver. 1.2.10 ---

- Added new language files: German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Portuguese and Chinese Simplified.
  Some of these files were produced by professional translators (Korean, Chinese Simplified), but others
  are generated with help of an automated translation tool, so do not hesitate to report mistakes.

- Refactored unit tests, so now they support fixtures and execute faster then before.

- Added new test suites LangFileTests and CrproberTests.

- Fixed: Typo in HttpRequestSender.cpp (issue 79)

- Fixed: Replace relative paths with OutDir and IntDir (issue 80)

- Fixed: MD5 files are not removed (issue 83)

- Fixed: CrashSender manifest file prevents CrashSender from launching in x64 (issue 87)

--- Ver. 1.2.9 ---

- Compiler/linker output for x64 platform is now directed to bin\x64, while output dir for Win32 platform
  is the same (bin) (issue 77).

- Improved documentation (extended "Using CrashRpt API" and "An Example of Using API", "Writing Robust Code" sections)

- Annotated code with SAL macros and fixed some PREfast warnings (this should fix some potential stability and
  security issues).

- New function crAddScreenshot2() allows to define JPEG quality.

- Implemented Jpeg image preview in Error Report Details dialog.

  would need to configure SMTP transport without querying DNS MX (mail exchange) record.

--- Ver. 1.2.3 ---

- Improved file preview in DetailDlg. Now a file can be previewed in HEX or in text mode.

- Ability to customize the port for SMTP connection.

- Modifyed communication between CrashRpt.dll and CrashSender.exe. Now XML file is used for this purpose instead of named pipe.

- Refactored code. After crash, all complex actions are done outside of the crashed process (inside of CrashSender.exe).
  This includes taking desktop screenshot, minidump generation, file copying, file compression and sending.

- Introduced silent mode (CrashRpt sends report silently without showing GUI). 
  This is useful for services and server processes.

- Improved documentation (restyling).

- Introduced multi-part HTTP uploads. This will help to send large error reports more effectively.

  in unzipped state, compression is performed during sending procedure. This will be required for
  huge reports (that will be fully supported in the future).

- Added support of x64 platform (issue 7).

- Added an ability to make screenshots of the screen or the main app window on crash 
  through crAddScreenshot() function (issue 8).
